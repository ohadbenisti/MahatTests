Question 4
An array of integers is called "complete" if it satisfies the following conditions
- The size of the array is an odd number.
- In the first half of the array there are only single-digit positive numbers.
- The central member (middle) is 0.
- In the second half of the array there is not a single positive number.
The array arr={1, 7,3, 0, 13, 131, 44} is a "perfect array" since it meets all four requirements.
- The length of the array 7 is odd.
- The first half } 1,7,3 { contains only single digit numbers.
- The second half } 13,131,44 { does not contain single digit numbers.
- The central member is 0.
(8 points) a. Write an operation that receives an array of integers and returns a true value if it is a "perfect array", if not,
The operation will return a false value.
