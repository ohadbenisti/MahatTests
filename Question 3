Question 3
The Tank department has the following features:
The capacity of the fuel tank - capacity, of integer type - int
Amount of fuel - amount from a complete type - int
In the Tank class, a constructor action has been defined that receives a parameter of each attribute and determines the values of
bone properties. The class includes get/set operations for each of the attributes.
(2 pts) A. Write a constructive operation that accepts the capacity of the fuel tank and produces an empty tank.
(2 points) b. Write in the Tank class an internal operation that returns true if there is fuel in the tank, otherwise the operation returns false.
(3 pts) C. Write in the Tank department an internal operation boolean is possible (int num, char op).
The operation will receive the mission type op and the amount of fuel num.
The task type can be one of the characters '+' or '-'.
If op is equal to '+', the amount of fuel num must be added to the tank,
If op is equal to '-', the amount of fuel num must be taken from the tank.
If the task can be performed, the operation will return true , otherwise the operation will return false .
(3 points (d. Write an external action static int fill Tank t 1, Tank t 2).
The operation returns the maximum amount of fuel that can be transferred from tank t1 to tank t2.
